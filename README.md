ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cHa-dotlearnsonline. my full name is Chawanangwa Phiri. I have been teaching myself
how to code for some time now. I'm also a medical doctor in Zambia.
### What did I use to learn coding?
I mainly used EdX's CS50 courses the introductory course to computer science and CS50 webprogramming with python and Javascript.
I have completed both courses and have free digital certificates. ![This is my CS50x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80148629/179385103-0cd83171-09c0-40c9-a377-1eb6747e663b.png).

### What am I interested in?
I am currently interested in web programming. I know some python and javascript. I also use HTML and CSS.
I use bootstrap a lot when I am making projects because it's really easy to use and they have a very helpfull website for looking up things.
I use the python Django framework to make all my projects.
I'm using my time to do as much web programming as I can. So that I can later on take the CS50 AI course.
I want to take it to have an understanding of how artificial intelligence really works.
### What can we collaborate on?
I'm open to anything that is python and javascript. So that I am able to build my skill in web programming
I'm also very willing to code for any django web programing project. I'm very commited to learning and improving my coding skill
